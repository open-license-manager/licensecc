# Open License Manager
![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/open-license-manager/open-license-manager.png "Build Status")

A license manager written in C/C++ for Windows and Linux environments.

It allows to protect the software you develop from unauthorized copies,
limit the usage in time, to a specific set of machines, or prevent the usage in 
virtualized environments. It is an Open License Manager that helps to keep your 
software closed ;-)

The software is made by 2 main sub-components:
 * a C library with no (or minimal) external dependencies (the part you have to integrate in your software).
 * a license generator written in C++ (allows you to generate a license).
 
these modules are planned....
 * a license [backoffice](../../issues/7) in php (in order to handle multiple licenses).
 * a license debugger to be sent to the final customer when there are licensing problems. 
 * a [log descriptor](../../issues/8) in order to decrypt logs generated by the license system.

You can notice 2 more sub-projects:
 * bootstrap: allows to generate private keys and modify the library on the fly after the downloading.
 * testing  : runs the tests (and publish the results on cdash)
 
Licensing
=====================
The project comes out with a very large freedom of use for everyone (and it will always be). 
It uses a BSD 3 clauses licensing schema. 

How to build
============

## prerequisites
GCC (Linux), MINGW or MSVC (Windows)
cmake, boost, openssl (Linux/MINGW), you can find detailed instruction for each [supported environment](https://github.com/open-license-manager/open-license-manager/wiki/Build-the-library) in the wiki. Below an overview of the basic build procedure:

```
git clone https://github.com/open-license-manager/open-license-manager.git
cd open-license-manager/
mkdir build
cd build
```

## on Linux
```
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install
make
make install
```

## on Windows (with MSVC 2015)
```
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install
cmake --build . --target install --config Release
```

## cross compile with MINGW on Linux
```
x86_64-w64-mingw32.static-cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install
make
make install
```

How to test
===========

## on Linux
```
make test
```

## on Windows (MSVC)
```
ctest -C Release
```

How to use
==========

This simple example shows how to integrate open-licence-manager into your project

```
$ cd example
$ cmake .
$ make
$ ./example
license ERROR :
    license file not found
the pc signature is :
    Jaaa-aaaa-MG9F-ZhBB
$ ../install/bin/license_generator example -s Jaaa-aaaa-MG9F-ZhBB -o example.lic 
$ ./example
licence OK
```
