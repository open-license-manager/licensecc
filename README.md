[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/open-license-manager/open-license-manager.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/open-license-manager/open-license-manager)
[![experimental](http://badges.github.io/stability-badges/dist/experimental.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges)[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-BSD%203--Clause-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause)

A copy protection, licensing software written in C/C++ for Windows and Linux.

It allows to protect the software you develop from unauthorized copies,
limit the usage in time, to a specific set of machines, or prevent the usage in 
virtualized environments. It is an Open License Manager that helps to keep your 
software closed :smirk: . A comprehensive [list of features](https://github.com/open-license-manager/open-license-manager/wiki/features), and their status is available in the project wiki.

## License
The project is donated to the community. It comes with a very large freedom of use for everyone, and it will always be. 
It uses a [BSD 3 clauses](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) licensing schema, that allows the inclusion in commercial software. 


## Project Structure
The software is made by 2 main sub-components:
 * a C library with no (or minimal) external dependencies (the part you have to integrate in your software).
 * a license generator written in C++ (allows you to generate a license).
 
these modules are planned....
 * a license [backoffice](../../issues/7) in php (in order to handle multiple licenses).
 * a license debugger to be sent to the final customer when there are licensing problems. 
 * a [log descriptor](../../issues/8) in order to decrypt logs generated by the license system.

You can notice 2 more sub-projects:
 * bootstrap: allows to generate private keys and modify the library on the fly after the downloading.
 * testing  : runs the tests (and publish the results on cdash)

#How to build

Below an overview of the basic build procedure, you can find detailed instructions for each [supported environment](https://github.com/open-license-manager/open-license-manager/wiki/Build-the-library) in the wiki. 

## prerequisites
 * compilsers: GCC (Linux), MINGW or MSVC (Windows) 
 * tools/libs: cmake, boost, openssl (Linux/MINGW).
