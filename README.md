It allows to protect the software you develop from unauthorized copies,
limit the usage in time, to a specific set of machines, or prevent the usage in 
virtualized environments. It is an Open License Manager that helps to keep your 
software closed :smirk: . A comprehensive [list of features](https://github.com/open-license-manager/open-license-manager/wiki/features), and their status is available in the project wiki.

## License
The project is donated to the community. It comes with a very large freedom of use for everyone, and it will always be. 
It uses a [BSD 3 clauses](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) licensing schema, that allows free modification and inclusion in commercial software. 

## Project Structure
The software is made by 2 main sub-components:
-   a C++ library with a nice C api, `licensecc` with minimal (or no) external dependencies (the part you have to integrate in your software) that is the project you're currently in.
-   a license generator lcc-license-generator `lcc` for customizing the library and generate the licenses.
 
The following modules are planned...
-   a license [backoffice](../../issues/7) in php (in order to handle multiple licenses).
-   a license debugger to be sent to the final customer when there are licensing problems.
-   a [log descriptor](../../issues/8) in order to decrypt logs generated by the license system.

## How to build
Below an overview of the basic build procedure, you can find detailed instructions for [linux](https://github.com/open-license-manager/open-license-manager/wiki/Build-the-library) or [windows](https://github.com/open-license-manager/open-license-manager/wiki/Build-the-library-windows) in the wiki. 

### Prerequisites
-   Operating system: Linux(Ubuntu, CentOS), Windows
-   compilers       : GCC (Linux) MINGW (Linux cross compile for Windows), MINGW or MSVC (Windows) 
-   tools           : cmake(>3.6), git, make/ninja(linux)
-   libs            : If target is Linux Openssl is required. Windows depends only on system libraries. Boost is necessary to build license generator and to run the tests but it's NOT a dependency of the final `licensecc` library. 

For a complete list of dependencies and supported environments see [the wiki](https://github.com/open-license-manager/open-license-manager/wiki/Dependencies)

Clone the project. It has submodules, don't forget the `--recursive` option.

```console
git clone --recursive https://github.com/open-license-manager/open-license-manager.git
cd open-license-manager/
cd build
```

### build on Linux

```console
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install
make
make install
```

### build on Windows (with MSVC 2015)

```console
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" -DBOOST_ROOT="{Folder where boost is}" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install
cmake --build . --target install --config Release
```

### cross compile with MINGW on Linux

```console
x86_64-w64-mingw32.static-cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install
make
make install
```

## How to test

### on Linux

```console
make test
```

### on Windows (MSVC)

```console
ctest -C Release
```
