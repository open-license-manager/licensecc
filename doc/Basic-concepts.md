#Basic concepts and terminology

##Project
A project corresponds to one application where the licensing system need to be integrated.
Each project has its own private key and its own folder where `licensecc` is compiled. 
Currently we support only one project per (build) machine. This is especially true in Windows, where the private key has the same name for all the projects.

##Features
Features let licensed application to selectively enable or disable functions in the application, features are part of the original license, they do not have hardware identifications, they only have validity date.
